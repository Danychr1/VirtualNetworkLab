# Creating and Securing Networks with Cisco Packet Tracer

## Introduction:

  This project focused on developing hands-on networking skills through simulation. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, we designed and configured a virtual network environment, allowing us to practice device setup, connectivity testing, and troubleshooting without the need for physical hardware. In addition to core networking tasks, we explored Internet of Things (IoT) integration and applied basic cybersecurity measures to secure the simulated infrastructure. This lab provided a practical foundation for understanding real-world networking concepts in a safe and controlled environment.

## Description: 

  In this project, we practiced network configuration and troubleshooting by building simulated networks, rather than relying on physical equipment. We created our own network, configured various devices, and explored concepts related to the Internet of Things (IoT) and cybersecurity. The lab was completed using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Environments and Utilities Used: 

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS)
